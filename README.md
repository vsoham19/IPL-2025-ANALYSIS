# IPL-2025-ANALYSIS

This project analyzes the IPL 2025 season using Python and Power BI to extract meaningful insights and select the best Playing 11 based on data-driven criteria.

## Data Sources
- Ball-by-ball data
- Match summaries
- Most runs and 
- Most wickets tables

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas, matplotlib)
- Power BI (DAX, interactive dashboards)
- Jupyter Notebook


## Data Relationships
To enable rich, cross-sectional analysis, I established relationships among key columns (such as player names, teams, and match IDs) across all datasets. This interconnected data model allowed for seamless exploration and deeper insights

## Key Insights
- Visualizations for top batsmen, bowlers, deliveries, and match outcomes
- Data-driven selection of the best Playing 11 as well as Impact players

## Playing 11 Selection Criteria
1. Top Order: 3 batsmen with 500+ runs and 140+ strike rate
2. Middle Order: Batsmen with average > 30 and strike rate > 160
3. Spin Bowlers: Bowling average < 25 and economy < 9
4. Seam Bowlers: 17+ wickets, bowling average < 25, economy < 9

## Approach
- Used pandas and matplotlib for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization
- Built interactive dashboards in Power BI
- Selected the best Playing 11 using both Python and DAX

## Visuals
- Batsman, bowler, delivery, and match insights (see PNG files in the repo)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook for Python analysis
3. Open the Power BI dashboard for interactive exploration
